memorist
========

This is a project to learn to memorize not only a list of numbers
using the loci method and the major system, but a table/array
of values.

It is in beta state and does for now nothing more than
display a 4x5 array of three digit numbers.

On pressing space the array is hidden, on pressing ESC is becomes
visible again.
