memorist
========

This is a project to learn to memorize not only a list of numbers
using the loci method and the major system, but a table/array
of values.

It is in beta state and does for now nothing more than
display a 4x5 array of three digit numbers.

On pressing space the array is hidden, on pressing ESC is becomes
visible again.

When the array is hidden, the console tells you which row or column 
to reproduce from memory.

So this prototype contains all basic functionality, just not
everything in the app window, and options etc. are missing.
